"# PyCrashCourse2ndEd" 

Using this project as a way to document my progress as I continue to learn about Python, Git, and GitHub through Eric Matthes's "Python Crash Course, 2nd Edition".

At this point I have passed WGU's Introduction to Python class and I am looking to put it into practice. 

The first half of this book is mostly a review of concepts and exercises that any Python user should be familiar with. 

The second half consists of three heftier projects: 

    1. A clone of Space Invaders called "Alien Invasion" built within PyGame. 
    2. Visualizing data with Matplotlib and Plotly, and working with APIs (namely, GitHub's) and CSV files. 
    3. Creating a webpage with user accounts using Django, bootstrap4, and Heroku. 

I'm having fun so far and I'm excited to see where this goes! 

If you're also working through this book, I'm interested to hear about your experience.
